# Project Overview
This is a jekyll project with integration of bootstrap.
Also, the project dependencies and packages are managed by bower.
Unlike other similar projects, this project aims at a pretty much clean
integration and fast utilization.

# Project goal

Currently, we enabled a basic bootstrap style site by using jekyll. The next
stage will be adding some new themes. For example: the W3 ui, the semantic ui, etc.
Afterwards, we will seek to build some popular templates for this project.
